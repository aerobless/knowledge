### Pension

* [How many 3a accounts make are useful in Switzerland](https://finpension.ch/en/how-many-3a-accounts-make-any-sense-at-all/)
  * tldr; 6-10 accounts since they can be paid out from 5 years before pension age until 5 years after (provided you keep working), not all cantons handle tax progression the same way so it might not matter, but it's better to be safe than sorry.
