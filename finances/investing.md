## Special Corporate Situations

### Spinoffs

* Company A spins off a devision into a new company B
* Spin off companies can be profitable to invest in because of two reasons
  * For large institutional investors they're too small two invest in
  * For private investors they're two new and there's not enough analyst coverage. This makes private investors hesitate to buy the stock as well.
* This creates a window of opportunity where the stock of a newly spun off company is below its actual value.

### Mergers and acquisitions

* When company A buys company B they generally use cash + stocks to buy the other company. However sometimes company A will also use other security to pay for company B.
* When company A pays e.g. a part in bonds the investors receiving the payout will often just sell the bonds because they're not interested in holding those.
* This creates an opportunity to buy those other securities cheaper.
