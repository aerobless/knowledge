## Second Brain

> Building A Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections weâ€™ve gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks. ([source](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/))

I use [Notion](saas/notion.md) as my second brain. If you'd like to learn more about starting a second brain, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8) by Ali Abdaal is a good introduction into the topic.

## Digital Garden

Similar to a second brain but public. This page is my digital garden. It's made with [gitbook](saas/#note-taking).

> A garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ posts are linked through contextual associations. ([source](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners))
