Morocco is a North African country bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, distinguished by its Berber, Arabian, and European cultural influences. Known for its rich history, Morocco features diverse landscapes ranging from the Sahara Desert to the High Atlas Mountains, alongside bustling markets like those in Marrakesh.

# Marrakesh

Marrakesh in late November was a delightful escape, with warm days and cool mornings that made it the perfect time to visit. My girlfriend and I stayed in two charming riads, starting with Riad Challa, nestled within the bustling souks. The souks were a fascinating maze of vibrant market streets, brimming with life and the occasional curious cat darting between stalls. It was a sensory explosion of colors, scents, and sounds, with the fragrant spices and the rhythmic calls of vendors creating an unforgettable atmosphere.

We took time to explore the city's iconic landmarks: the lively Jemaa el-Fnaa square, the serene Bahia Palace, and the intricately decorated Saadian Tombs, where sultans of the past rest in splendor. Each site offered a unique glimpse into Marrakesh's rich history and culture.

One of the highlights was dining on rooftop terraces in the evenings. Overlooking the cityscape as the sun set and the call to prayer echoed in the distance was magical. However, while the ubiquitous tajine, the national dish, was delicious, the limited vegetarian options became a bit repetitive after several meals. The city's culinary focus leans heavily on local flavors, and truly great international dining options were harder to find.

Despite this, Marrakesh left a lasting impression with its blend of energy and tranquility, modernity and tradition. Whether wandering through the souks, marveling at the historic sites, or simply enjoying the warm November sunshine, itâ€™s a city that envelops you in its charm and stays with you long after you leave.

# Sahara Desert Tour

After spending a few days immersing ourselves in the vibrant energy of Marrakesh, we embarked on a three-day tour that took us through breathtaking landscapes and unforgettable stops, culminating in the awe-inspiring Sahara Desert.

## AÃ¯t Benhaddou

Our first major stop was AÃ¯t Benhaddou, a stunning UNESCO World Heritage site and an ancient trading outpost along the caravan route between the Sahara and Marrakesh. Fans of _Game of Thrones_ might recognize it as Yunkai, the "Yellow City," featured in Season 3 when Daenerys Targaryen conquers it to free the slaves.

We had an amazing guide who brought the history of this kasbah to life. He even demonstrated the traditional method of making paintings with natural ingredients like green tea, saffron, and ashâ€”a fascinating blend of art and storytelling. Climbing to the top of the kasbah for sweeping views of the valley was a highlight, showcasing its strategic importance in the past.

## Monkey fingers overnight stay

Set against the striking landscape of the DadÃ¨s Valley, our stop near the Monkey Fingers rock formations offered a unique glimpse into local life. The family running the guesthouse welcomed us warmly, serving a traditional Berber dinner that captured the essence of the region. After dinner, they played lively music, filling the crisp evening air with rhythm and warmth. As night fell, the temperature dropped significantly, adding a cool contrast to the dayâ€™s warmth and the cozy atmosphere indoors.

## Tinghir

Tinghir offered a peaceful contrast to the bustling cities. We visited a local family who warmly welcomed us into their home and demonstrated the intricate craft of traditional carpet weaving, sharing stories of their heritage. Before heading to the dramatic Todra Gorge, we took a leisurely walk t hrough the lush fields, soaking in the beauty of the landscape.

 The gorge itself was breathtaking, with towering red cliffs and a narrow riverbed creating a natural wonder. On the other side of the gorge, we spotted adorable wild donkies climbing the rocky terrain.

## Sahara Desert

The highlight of the tour was, of course, reaching the Sahara Desert. Riding camels through the golden dunes of Erg Chebbi at sunset felt surreal, as if we had stepped into another world. Spending the night in a Berber camp under a sky bursting with stars was an unforgettable experience, a perfect ending to this incredible journey.

# Essaouira

Essaouira was a refreshing change of pace, offering a mix of coastal charm, rich history, and moments of calm. On the way there, we visited a womenâ€™s cooperative where argan oil is made using traditional methodsâ€”a fascinating insight into this iconic Moroccan product and a chance to support the artisans behind it.

The townâ€™s white-and-blue architecture and relaxed vibe made it instantly inviting. Fans of _Game of Thrones_ might recognize Essaouira as Astapor, where Daenerys secures her Unsullied army in Season 3. We strolled through the lively harbor, watched fishermen unload their catches, and explored the souks and old town, soaking in the coastal energy. Before heading back to Marrakesh, we ended the day with a quiet moment at a cafÃ©, sipping Moroccan tea and enjoying the gentle sea breeze.
