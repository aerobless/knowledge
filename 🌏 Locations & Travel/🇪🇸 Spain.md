## Food

* **Gandario:** Tiny tapas bar. Had really good vegan sausage with fries and different sauces. But beware that it is tiny, if you come at a bad time you'll have to wait.
* **Vinitus Gran Via Madrid**: Highly rated tapas place with a nice selection. Indoor seating.<
* **Tapa Tapa Montera**: Pretty good tapas with a nice area to sit outside in the street and enjoy a beer.
