# MalmÃ¶

MalmÃ¶ is a coastal city in southern Sweden. It lies just across from Copenhagen and can be reached easily by train going over the Ã–rsund Bridge.

When it's sunny it can be a nice excursion to cycle out to the various viewpoints on the coast.

The city of MalmÃ¶ itself is also very cycle friendly with dedicated bike lanes and traffic lights. Another thing to do in MalmÃ¶ is to rent a pedalo and cruise around the many canals.

Also if you've got some time to kill be sure to look around the many little shops. One really cool place is the [Sci-Fi book store](https://goo.gl/maps/WZz9JKDsRTnM7zydA). They've got soooo many cool books.
