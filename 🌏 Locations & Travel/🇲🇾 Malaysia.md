The city is a melting pot of diverse cultural influences, notably Chinese, Indian, and Malay, which is most evident in its eclectic cuisine, festivals, and vibrant street art.

## Food halls & bar street

In George Town, the lively food courts and bar streets offer a gastronomic paradise featuring local and international flavours. The bar streets contribute to a vibrant nightlife. Alcohol is widely available. However, it is more expensive due to Malaysia being a Muslim-majority country.
