Heya! 👋  I'm Theo 😄, a software engineer from the [[🇨🇭 Switzerland| land of chocolate & cheese]] 🇨🇭. I like to pursue creative endeavours such as developing my own [[VR Development| VR Game]], building crazy [automations for my home](🏠%20Home%20Automation.md) and various other stuff. Of course it's not all related to tech. I also enjoy [[🌏 Locations & Travel| travelling]], photography, working out among other things.

Welcome to my digital garden. 🪴 If you haven't heard of the concept before you can find a good primer [here](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). It's basically something in between a personal note collection ([second brain](💡%20Knowledge%20Management.md#Second%20Brain)), a wiki and a blog.
