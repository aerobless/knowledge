# Checklist deductions

*   Commute expenses
  *   Blanket deduction bicycle 700 CHF
  *   Public Transport to work: deduct monthly subscription instead of yearly
    *   It may also be possible to deduct a 1st class ticket (see [KGeld](https://www.kgeld.ch/artikel/artikeldetail/pendlerabzug-bei-bedarf-auch-in-der-1-klasse)), although this hinges on the claim that you are working during the commute. I'm unsure if this would be accepted for short distances.
*   Meal expenses
  *   blanket deduction 3200 CHF / year
*   General work expenses
  *   blanked deduction of 3%
*   Professional development
  *   blanket deduction of 500 CHF
