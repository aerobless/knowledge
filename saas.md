# SaaS

## Note taking

* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/): Personal note-taking app that can be morphed into any kind of tool you desire. I use it to keep track of my tasks, ideas, long-term goals and so on. It's basically my private counterpart to this wiki.
* [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com): Used to build & render this site.

## Cloud Storage

* [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/): I use Google Drive as my primary cloud storage location for all files that I want to keep permanently available. This includes scanned documents \(bills etc.\), photographs \(in Google Photos\), backups and various other files. The only exception are files that are tightly bound to the Apple ecosystem \(such as Pages/Numbers documents or various files of specific iOS applications\).
* [iCloud Drive](https://www.apple.com/icloud): iCloud Drive is my secondary cloud storage location. On it I keep a backup copy of photos and the files created and stored by apps in the Apple ecosystem.

## Entertainment

* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/): Primary video streaming provider.
* [Amazon Prime](https://www.primevideo.com/): Secondary video streaming provider.
* [Spotify](https://spotify.com): Primary music streaming provider.
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/): Not sure how to classify this one.. but I do spend a lot of time on YouTube.
