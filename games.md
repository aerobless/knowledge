# ðŸ•¹ Games

## Lord of the Rings Online (LotRO)

This used to be my favourite MMO back in the day. The world is massive, highly detailed and contains lovely stories & quests. Although it does feel a bit dated in 2023 it's still the only game that does middle earth any justice.

* [Shadows of Angmar Private Server](https://www.echoesofangmar.com/#home)

## Cyberpunk 2077

* [Edgerunners (Netflix, Anime)](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/edgerunners): Anime series playing in the game world of Cyberpunk 2077, worth watching. It made me want to play the game a second time :relaxed:.

## [Stray](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/?utm\_source=gamewebsite\&utm\_campaign=sitevisit\&utm\_medium=web) (2022)

Third person, adventure/story game about a cat escaping from a robot city. With some mystery and light puzzle elements to it. It took me around 5h to complete the main story but you can take longer if you look into all the nooks and crannies. It's well worth the time though. Playing the cat is really cute and interacting with the robots is often times heartwarming.

## [Hogwarts legacy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/990080/Hogwarts\_Legacy/) (2023)

Hogwarts Legacy is an immersive, open-world action RPG. The best thing about it is the world building and atmosphere. It makes you feel like you really are in Hogwarts. I especially loved the seasons changing during the game and discovering all the hidden nooks and crannies. Completing the game took me about 57h which is a fair length for a full price triple A game. The main story and the quests are engaging but not really on the level of a Witcher 3 or similar games. Most quests are very linear in nature and there are almost no choices with any consequences. It also feels a bit strange to have most professors in Hogwarts cater to your every wish - even going as far as to show you the room of requirement. This felt pretty out of place given how powerful that room is.\
Nevertheless the game is well worth playing. Hopefully there will be an expansion at some point.
