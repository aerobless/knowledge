## Cyberpunk 2077

* [Edgerunners (Netflix, Anime)](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/edgerunners): Anime series playing in the game world of Cyberpunk 2077, worth watching. It made me want to play the game a second time :relaxed:.

## [Stray](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/?utm\_source=gamewebsite\&utm\_campaign=sitevisit\&utm\_medium=web) (2022)

Third person, adventure/story game about a cat escaping from a robot city. With some mystery and light puzzle elements to it. It took me around 5h to complete the main story but you can take longer if you look into all the nooks and crannies. It's well worth the time though. Playing the cat is really cute and interacting with the robots is often times heartwarming.
