Hogwarts Legacy is an immersive, open-world action RPG. The best thing about it is the world building and atmosphere. It makes you feel like you really are in Hogwarts. I especially loved the seasons changing during the game and discovering all the hidden nooks and crannies. Completing the game took me about 57h which is a fair length for a full price triple A game. The main story and the quests are engaging but not really on the level of a Witcher 3 or similar games. Most quests are very linear in nature and there are almost no choices with any consequences. It also feels a bit strange to have most professors in Hogwarts cater to your every wish - even going as far as to show you the room of requirement. This felt pretty out of place given how powerful that room is.\
Nevertheless the game is well worth playing. Hopefully there will be an expansion at some point.
