*Factorio* is a real-time strategy game where players build and manage factories to automate the production of increasingly complex items. Players gather resources, research technologies, and expand their industrial systems while defending against alien creatures on an alien planet.

Factorio is one of my favourite games. I have over 152h played so far.

In December 2024 an extension called [Space Age](https://www.factorio.com/space-age/content) was published for Factorio. It adds space platforms and 4 new planets to the base game. It’s super fun and I’ve been playing it a lot lately.
