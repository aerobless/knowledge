The brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, responsible for processing sensory information, controlling movements, and regulating cognitive functions like memory, emotion, and decision-making. It is composed of billions of neurons that communicate through synapses, enabling complex thought processes and coordination throughout the body.

# Memory

## Re-training your own memories

I’ve noticed that as I grow older I’m having a harder time to remember specific events in the past. Although in daily life it has never been a problem, it still bugs me when I’m unable to recall a specific memory. 

I’ve come up with the following novel way to retrain my own mind on my own memories:
When using a [[💡 Knowledge Management#Second Brain|second brain]] such as [[💎 Obsidian|obsidian]] you can use [[🤖 Tools|AI]] to ask it questions about the notes inside its storage. Personally I’m using the plugin [Smart Second Brain](https://github.com/your-papa/obsidian-Smart2Brain) with GPT-4o. I can then tell it e.g.

> [!NOTE] Prompt
> I want to train my memories. Ask me a specific questions about something that happend in 2023. Don't write a summary or anything else.

It then asks me e.g. “What did you discover in March 2023?” linking to my private daily/2023/Retrospective file. I can then attempt to remember and finally visit the link to check the answer. In this case I had “Discovered GitHub CoPilot” noted down for March 2023.
