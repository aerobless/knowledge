## Notes

* [Glucose Monitoring and Metabolic Health Startups Scale up](https://insider.fitt.co/glucose-monitoring-and-metabolic-health-startups-scale-up/)
* [I don't have diabetes, but I wore an implant that measures the sugar in my blood to see if I could hack my performance. I'd put it back on again if I could.](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-track-blood-sugar-with-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-2019-11?r=US\&IR=T)
* [Glucose "Abott Freestyle Libre Sensor" can be bought in CH.. but it costs 80 CHF/14days](https://www.zurrose-shop.ch/de/abbott-freestyle-libre-sensor-1-stk-/?channable=01622769640036363835343234b2\&CMP=Shopping\&layer=cum5\_2021\&gclid=CjwKCAjwoNuGBhA8EiwAFxomAysi35XWXPcAiP5B7F-kikNTLt3vFh44z3NrqtFDrzeEHGvWC73EwxoCyYUQAvD_BwE)
  * not sure if that's all that's needed or whether Levels & Nutrisense stick an additional device on this to help in transfering data
* Startups that do glucose monitoring for health/fitness benefits:
  * [Nutrisense](https://www.nutrisense.io/how-it-works)
  * [Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com)
    * [How it's applied (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrbnuCsYkcs)
* Currently it seems to be too expensive at 130CHF/month --> 1500CHF/year when there's no medical need for it.
