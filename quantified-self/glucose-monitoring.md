# Glucose Monitoring

This seems to be the next big health thing. Real time continuous glucose monitoring via self-applicable 14days sensors. This allows for automatic tracking of diets and getting various other health stats.

## Notes

* [Glucose Monitoring and Metabolic Health Startups Scale up](https://insider.fitt.co/glucose-monitoring-and-metabolic-health-startups-scale-up/)
* [Glucose "Abott Freestyle Libre Sensor" can be bought in CH.. but it costs 80 CHF/14days](https://www.zurrose-shop.ch/de/abbott-freestyle-libre-sensor-1-stk-/?channable=01622769640036363835343234b2&CMP=Shopping&layer=cum5_2021&gclid=CjwKCAjwoNuGBhA8EiwAFxomAysi35XWXPcAiP5B7F-kikNTLt3vFh44z3NrqtFDrzeEHGvWC73EwxoCyYUQAvD_BwE)
  * not sure if that's all that's needed or whether Levels & Nutrisense stick an additional device on this to help in transfering data
* Startups that do glucose monitoring for health/fitness benefits:
  * [Nutrisense](https://www.nutrisense.io/how-it-works)
  * [Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com/)
* Currently it seems to be too expensive at 160CHF/month --&gt; 2000 CHF/year but I'd be curious to try it if it comes down in price to half of that
