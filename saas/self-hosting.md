# ðŸ“€ Self-Hosting

## Server software

* [Proxmox VE](../operating-systems/proxmox-ve.md): open source virtualisation platform
* [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/): Base Image to run self-hosted applications
* [Unraid OS](https://unraid.net/product): A combination of Yunohost and Proxmox. Paid OS that has a nice UI that allows the creation of VMs and installation of pre-packaged self-hosted software such as Firefly etc. One-time purchase. I don't use this, but if I had to setup a new server I would seriously consider it.
