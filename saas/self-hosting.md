# ðŸ“€ Self-Hosting

## Finance

* [Firefly III](https://firefly-iii.org/): A free and open source personal finance manager. Can be installed via Yunohost, Unraid or via docker compose. Is inteded to track expenses & budgets, doesn't track investments, stocks etc.
* [Ghostfol.io](https://ghostfol.io/en/home/overview): Open source wealth management software by a swiss developer. Focused on investments, stocks etc. Complementary to Firefly. Can be installed via unraid or docker compose. Is also available as SaaS version free & paid. Still relatively new and therefor unproven how long it will stay around. I don't use this yet because it's not supported by Yunohost and setting it up would be a bit manual work. But it looks good.

## Server software

* [Proxmox VE](../operating-systems/proxmox-ve.md): open source virtualisation platform
* [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/): Base Image to run self-hosted applications
* [Unraid OS](https://unraid.net/product): A combination of Yunohost and Proxmox. Paid OS that has a nice UI that allows the creation of VMs and installation of pre-packaged self-hosted software such as Firefly etc. One-time purchase. I don't use this, but if I had to setup a new server I would seriously consider it.
