# ‚òÅ SaaS & Web

## Backup & Immortality

* [Wayback Machine - The internet archive](https://archive.org/web/): The largest public archive of web content. It contains more then 843 billion web pages. I use it to backup this wiki and other projects of mine for eternity.
* [GitHub Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/): Contains a snapshot of all active public GitHub repositories on 02/02/2020. Sadly this wiki is not contained because it didn't exist at the time. Only my home assistant configuration made it into the vault üôÉ. But I remain hopeful that GitHub will pull another snapshot at some point in the future.

## Cloud Storage

* [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/): I use Google Drive as my primary cloud storage location for all files that I want to keep permanently available. This includes scanned documents (bills etc.), photographs (in Google Photos), backups and various other files. The only exception are files that are tightly bound to the Apple ecosystem (such as Pages/Numbers documents or various files of specific iOS applications).
* [iCloud Drive](https://www.apple.com/icloud): iCloud Drive is my secondary cloud storage location. On it I keep a backup copy of photos and the files created and stored by apps in the Apple ecosystem.

## Content Aggregation

* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/): Save articles, websites, videos for later. I'm trying to establish a habit that I collect things I want to read later with this. So far I haven't succeed in using it regularly, but it seems like a good service.

## Content restrictions

* [12ft Ladder](https://12ft.io/): Paywall-Remover, allows you to read articles that are blocked by a pay-wall.
* [Paywall Bypass Extension](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome): Chrome extension that allows to bypass paywalls for common newspapers.
* [archive.today](https://archive.ph/): Archives pages & removes their paywall. Works in some places where 12ft ladder is blocked.

## Data Visualization

* [SankeyMATIC](https://sankeymatic.com/): Text to image sankey diagram builder (data split into channels and then even finer channels so you can see where it leads).

## Entertainment

* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com): Primary video streaming provider.
* [Amazon Prime](https://www.primevideo.com): Secondary video streaming provider.
* [Spotify](https://spotify.com): Primary music streaming provider.
  * my public Spotify profile can found [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/31szfhpecrrddes73llrsxomp2pu?si=d391c94e5cee4a3d)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com): Not sure how to classify this one.. but I do spend a lot of time on YouTube.

## Note taking

* [Notion](https://www.notion.so): Personal note-taking app that can be morphed into any kind of tool you desire. I use it to keep track of my tasks, ideas, long-term goals and so on. It's basically my private counterpart to this wiki.
* [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com): Used to build & render this site.

## [Self-hosted](self-hosting.md)

## VPN

* [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/): Zeroconf VPN solution based on WireGuard. Works amazingly well together with a [Home Assistant Community Add-On](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-tailscale). The HA addon can act as a gateway into my local network. Also very cool that you can use Google, MS or other global IDP accounts to authenticate yourself. The service is free with some pretty generous limits.
