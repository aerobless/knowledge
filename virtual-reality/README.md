# Virtual Reality

I own a [Oculus Quest 2](https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/) headset which I use regularly to play BeatSaber and other VR games. 

I do get affected by motion sickness in VR games where a lot of joystick movement is required so I mostly enjoy playing games that are room-scale or have good motion-sickness suppressing movement strategies implemented. A game with excellent movement is for example "Until you fall".

You can find my rank playing custom songs on [ScoreSaber](https://scoresaber.com/u/2142697109132096).

## Great games for the Oculus Quest

* [BeatSaber](https://beatsaber.com/): Probably my favourite game of all time and the "killer-app" of VR.
* [Until you fall](https://untilyoufall.schellgames.com/): Enjoyable hack & slash rogue-lite game.
* [FitXR](https://fitxr.com/): A great virtual workout. Although less fun then BeatSaber it still gets me moving when I don't want to leave the building for a workout.
* [In death unchained](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2334376869949242/?locale=en_US): Archery rogue-lite game set in a version of heaven & purgatory. Has excellent replay value and fairly good movement controls.

## BeatSaber

### PCVR

* [Downgrade BeatSaber Version on Oculus Store](https://computerelite.github.io/tools/Oculus/RiftDowngraderGuide.html): Needed when a new version is released and the mods aren't updated yet. It's also a good idea to disable auto-updates in the Oculus Store App.
* [Mod Manager for PCVR](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant): One stop shop for all modding needs: custom songs, score saber, custom song support for multiplayer, playlist manager etc.
* [Prevent Steam from auto-updating BeatSaber](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_UpdateSkipper#beatsaber-updateskipper): Since I have the oculus version I don't need this, but it might be helpful to some.

### Oculus Quest \(Standalone\)

* [BMBF - Install custom songs on BeatSaber for Oculus Quest](https://bmbf.dev/stable)
* [BSaber - Source for custom songs](https://bsaber.com/): To get good songs it's best to sort them by "Top" and go through the list by rating.
* [BeatSaver - Alternative source for custom songs](https://beatsaver.com/browse/hot)
* [Playlist Editor Pro](https://playlisteditorpro.com/): Windows application to organise playlists and more importantly allows for fast-switching between the modded version of BeatSaber and the retail version. This is important because the modded version can't connect to the official BeatSaber servers for multiplayer & highscores. Since I'm a mac user I run this application in a Parallels Windows VM occasionally.
