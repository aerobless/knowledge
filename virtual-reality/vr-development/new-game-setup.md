# New Game Setup

The steps I have to perform before I can start coding a new game:

1. Create new project from URP template
2. Setup [Oculus Integration for Unity](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-gs-overview/)
   1. Set Android as default export
   2. Update packages if necessary
   3. Import Oculus package
3. Clean up .gitignore (use template from github for unity) & commit
4. Setup [hurricane VR](https://www.cloudwalkingames.com/)
   1. use helper to setup everything
   2. launch demo scene to make sure everything works
5. Done for now
