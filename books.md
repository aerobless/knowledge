# ðŸ“š Books

I love reading fantasy & scifi books and occasionally other stuff as well. I use [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/aerobless) to keep track of the books I've [read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7725364?shelf=read) or [want to read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7725364?shelf=to-read). In 2021 I'm planning to read at least 21 books.

When I say reading I'm also including listening to audiobooks, which is something I also enjoy very much while doing other activities. I mainly use [audible.com ](http://audible.com)or for other downloaded media my [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) server and an iOS app called [Prologue](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prologue/id1459223267). Plex and Prologue are a great combination because they're essentially a self-hosted version of Audible, complete with having streaming access to all my own media and being able to download them onto the device when desired.

## Discovery

Discovering new books to read is always tricky, so here's a few good resources:

* [Esquire 50 best fantasy books of all time](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/g39385874/best-fantasy-books/): Not sure if I agree with the premise but the list has a good amount of lesser known/newer fantasy books on it as well.. so it's a good resource if you're already through the typical western authors & classics.

## Ebooks

### Utilities

* [WebToEpub (Chrome Extension)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtoepub/akiljllkbielkidmammnifcnibaigelm?hl=en): Used to download and convert web serials such as "[The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com)" to a epub file which can be read on common ebook readers.
