# ðŸ“š Reading

I love reading fantasy & scifi books and occasionally other stuff as well. I use [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/aerobless) to keep track of the books I've [read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7725364?shelf=read) or [want to read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7725364?shelf=to-read). In 2021 I'm planning to read at least 21 books.

When I say reading I'm also including listening to audiobooks, which is something I also enjoy very much while doing other activities. I mainly use [audible.com ](http://audible.com)or for other downloaded media my [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) server and an iOS app called [Prologue](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prologue/id1459223267). Plex and Prologue are a great combination because they're essentially a self-hosted version of Audible, complete with having streaming access to all my own media and being able to download them onto the device when desired.

## Discovery

Discovering new books to read is always tricky, so here's a few good resources:

* [Goodbooks.io](https://www.goodbooks.io/): Book recommendations by famous, successful people, e.g Elon Musk or Ali Abdaal.
* [Esquire 50 best fantasy books of all time](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/g39385874/best-fantasy-books/): Not sure if I agree with the premise but the list has a good amount of lesser known/newer fantasy books on it as well.. so it's a good resource if you're already through the typical western authors & classics.

## Ebooks

### Utilities

* [WebToEpub (Chrome Extension)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtoepub/akiljllkbielkidmammnifcnibaigelm?hl=en): Used to download and convert web serials such as "[The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com)" to a epub file which can be read on common ebook readers.
  * **How to use**
    * Install the Chrome Extension: [WebToEpub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtoepub/akiljllkbielkidmammnifcnibaigelm?hl=en)
    * Visit the "[Table of contents](https://wanderinginn.com/table-of-contents/)" page on the wandering inn website.
    * Click on the little puzzle icon in the top right corner of the browser and launch WebToEpub while you are on the "Table of contents" page.
    * You can now add some metadata and a book cover image if you want. Then select the chapters you want to include in the book. I typically create one epub file per book. So I'd include all chapters from 1.00 to Interlude for the first book.
    * Under advanced options there are some more options, but be sure to not include images otherwise the book files will be huge.
    * When you are ready click `Pack ePub` and the epub will be created and downloaded to your machine. You can then e.g. use Calibre to import the book in your eReader.
* [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com): eBook management software that can be extended with plugins. Useful to convert ebooks from various formats into the format needed for a specific ebook reader.
* [O'Reilly ePub Downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/my-oreilly-downloader/deebiaolijlopiocielojiipnpnaldlk) (Chrome Extension): Used to download O'Reilly eBooks as ePub so they can be read on a Kindle or similar eReader. Very useful if you have a O'Reilly subscription through your workplace or school.
