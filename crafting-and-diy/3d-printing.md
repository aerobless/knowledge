## Problem Solving

### Warping at the corners ([lnk](https://www.wevolver.com/article/what-causes-3d-print-warping-and-how-to-prevent-it))

Warping occurs when the PLA cools too quickly. This can be mitigated by:

* Enable raft or brim
* Increase heat of bed
* Enclose printer (keep doors shut during print)
