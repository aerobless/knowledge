# ðŸ–¨ 3D Printing

## Tools

* Creality Ender 3 V2
* Slicer: Creality Slicer or CURA. Creality Slicer is a stripped down version of CURA with ready to use profiles
* [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/)&#x20;

## Problem Solving

### Warping at the corners ([lnk](https://www.wevolver.com/article/what-causes-3d-print-warping-and-how-to-prevent-it))

Warping occurs when the PLA cools too quickly. This can be mitigated by:

* Enable raft or brim
* Increase heat of bed
* Enclose printer (keep doors shut during print)

### Print lifts off the bed ([lnk](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/ae7pbf/pla\_lifting\_off\_bed\_during\_prints\_cant\_figure\_out/))

When there is a draft the model cools off faster at the edges where the draft of cool air occurs. Remedies are:

* Print skirt that keeps the warm air near the actual model
* Enclosure around the printer that keeps the warm air within

## Cool models to print

* **Calibration**
  * [Benchy (Test Model to calibrate printer)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622), printed to verify that printer works well after long time without use
* **Wallets**
  * [Slim Card Wallet for 8 cards with money strap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4797082)
  * [Minimalist wallet with money strap, solid screwed](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3572911)
  * [Minimalist expandable wallet with strap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4831962)
* **Gaming**
  * [Stadia Controller Wall Mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4893266), printed on 03.04.2023. Printed without supports at 35% infill with layer height of 1.7mm. Works well, used zip ties instead of screws to attach it to furniture.
* **Toys**
  * **"Lego" Bricks**
    * [Printable bricks](https://printablebricks.com/): Lego compatible brick models, printed some 4x blocks - they work well but aren't support strong, it's important to be carefull when unsticking them from the print bed otherwise the internal structures may break off.
