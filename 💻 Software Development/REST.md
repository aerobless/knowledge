REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications, where clients interact with resources via stateless HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. RESTful APIs utilize standard web protocols and data formats, promoting scalability and simplicity in web services by separating client and server concerns.
