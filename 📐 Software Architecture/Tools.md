# Enterprise Architecture

- [Archimate](https://www.archimatetool.com/): Modelling toolkit for enterprise architecture.
- [Domain Schema Documentation](https://github.com/lizzyTheLizard/domain-schema-documentation):  Very useful tool to document the domain model of an application. You enter the domain model as a JSON schema and can then use it to generate a full [[OpenAPI]] Spec, [[â˜• Java|Java]] classes and more. Can be extended with plugins.
