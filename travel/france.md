## Paris

#### Getting around

Visiting all the points of interests in Paris is fairly easy thanks to the metro system. A single ride costs 1.9 euros but there's also the option to purchase a 2, 3 or 5 day pass. I opted for the 3 day pass which cost about 27 euros. So I'd have to ride 14 times to make the cost back.. but tbh just the convenience of not having to get a ticket every time is worth it. There's also the option of getting a multi ride ticket (10) for 16 euros. When staying longer it might be worth to get a Navigo card. When using the navigo card you can buy tickets on your phone and transfer them to the card via NFC. Sadly as of 2022 the Paris metro does not support fully phone based tickets nor Apple Wallet.

#### Metro Zones

Typically zones 1-3 are enough for anything within Paris itself. When visiting Versailles, the airport or Disneyland zones 4-5 are needed as well.

#### Credit card & mobile payment acceptance

Everywhere seems to support credit cards and mobile payments. I haven't had to use cash anywhere.

### Points of interest in Paris

#### [Le Louvre](https://www.louvre.fr/en)

Probably the worlds most famous museum. There's everything from famous painting such as the Mona Lisa to ancient greek and roman sculptures. Personally I don't like reading the little notes next to every object so I opted for the audio guide. The Louvre uses Nintendo 3DS for this purpose. It takes a bit of getting used to the controls but it works fairly well and the audio guide definitely adds a lot to the experience of otherwise static art pieces. It locates automatically the room you're in and you can then listen to a general overview of the room as well as info to some specific pieces. The descriptions are fairly to the point and interesting.

Getting to the Louvre is easy as there's a metro terminal underground directly connected to the Louvre. Alternatively you can also get out at Pyramides station if you have some time to kill before going into the museum.

It's important to buy the ticket online, then you can get in at a specific time without having a long wait. One thing to note is that there are two different queues for timed tickets at the glass pyramid. One is for all the half-hour time slots (e.g. 09:30, 10:30, 11:30) and the other for the full hour slots. Queuing at the right one is usually best ;-).
