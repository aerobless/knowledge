## Copenhagen

Copenhagen is a beautiful city with tons of things to see and do. Due to beeing close to the coas the weather can be a bit unpredictable. In July/early August it's best to always carry a light jacket and umbrella. It also helps to be a bit flexible with planning and just hop into a cafÃ© or book store when it rains for a bit.

### Cool things to see

#### Church of Our Saviour / Christiania

The church has a golden spire on top that you can climb. From there you get an amazing view over the city and climbing the spire is also a pretty cool experience in and of itself. There is an entry fee but imho it's well worth the money.

While waiting for our time slot to climb the spire we had a quick look at the commune Christiania. There is some cool street art there and one of the danish troll statues, but overall I found it a bit underwhelming. There was not a lot going on and there were mainly tourists wandering around the place.

#### Nyhavn

Beautiful harbour canal area with lots of little bars and restaurants. Ideal for taking a photo of the colourful townhouses and just wandering around a bit. This is also the spot where the river cruise boats dock for a quick bit of sightseeing.
