## POIs / Things to do in Rapperswil

* [Rapperswil Castle](https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/attractions/rapperswil-castle): The main thing to do is see the outside of the castle. There is a nice view over the city and also a small deer park enclosed in the fortification walls of the castle grounds. To main knowledge the castle itself is mainly used for events, marriage ceremonies etc.
* [Old town of Rapperswil](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/medieval-small-town/): Below the castle there is the old town of Rapperswil. It's a beautiful, medieval style old town with many little shops and restaurants. Perfect for some sightseeing and window shopping. &#x20;
* [Seebadi Rapperswil (Stadtbadi) (DE)](https://www.seebadirapperswil.ch/badi/): Nice lake bathing area, free of charge, with changing rooms, showers, free code lockers, a kiosk and supervision. Great for a quick swim in the lake.
* [Wooden Bridge / Holzsteg](https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/attractions/rapperswil-hurden-bridge): A wooden bridge across the straight of Lake Zurich. It originated in the middle ages and has been rebuilt since. It's a nice scenic walk, after reaching the other side you can take the train back to Rapperswil.
* [Insel Ufenau](https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/attractions/ufenau-island): One of two islands in the lake of Zurich close by Rapperswil. Insel Ufenau can be regularly accessed via public transportation ships leaving from the harbour of Rapperswil. The island contains a small church, a restaurant (mobile payments supported) and a scenic path around the island. Often there is also art, such as sculptures displayed on the island. It's also a good place for a picknick. Alternatively you can reach the island by stand up paddle (SUP) in about an 1-1.5h or in a rented paddle boat. The landing spot for private boats, paddle boats, SUPs is on the backside of the island facing away from Rapperswil. Beware that bathing is not allowed on the island itself since it's mostly a nature reservoir.

It can be reached via a  public shuttle boat service or via private boats, SUPs, paddle boats etc. The island contains a small restaurant (mobile payments supported), camping grounds, and multiple spots for bathing.
