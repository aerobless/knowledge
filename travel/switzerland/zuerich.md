## Local events

### Spring

* [Sechsel√§uten](https://www.sechselaeuten.ch/): Festival of the guilds of Zurich. Happens every year between the middle to the end of April on a Monday afternoon. As part of the event a puppet of a snowman (B√∂√∂g) filled with fireworks is burned on the [Sechsel√§utenplatz](https://goo.gl/maps/KsAXY1o47QSfM5Co6) in Zurich. The burning of the B√∂√∂g signifies the end of winter. Traditionally the time it takes for the B√∂√∂gs head to explode hints at how "nice" the summer will be. If it explodes faster the summer will be better.
