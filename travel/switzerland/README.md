## [Via Ferrata](../../sport/via-ferrata.md) (Klettersteig)

* [Kandersteg-Allmenalp](http://www.allmenalp.ch/aktivitaeten/klettersteig/?L=1): Beautiful [via ferrata](../../sport/via-ferrata.md) with two route options, multiple rope-bridges and a zip-line. Access via public transport is easily possible. Can be crowded on nice weekends. It is possible to do this as a beginner, but you should not be afraid of heights since the route is fairly exposed. Many youtube videos of the route exist which can be used to judge whether one is up to the task. It is important to know that it's not possible to exit the climb once started.
* [Brunni Zittergrat, Rigidalstock](https://brunni.ch/en/Detail/via-ferratas): There are multiple via ferrata in Brunni that are good for beginners. Right aftter the cable car there is an option to do either Zittergrat or BrunnistÃ¶ckli. They both end in the same place but Zittergrat has a somewhat higher difficulty. Both are suitable for beginners, although if you're unsure or afraid of exposed sections it's better to start with BrunnistÃ¶ckli.\
  To get to the Rigidalstock you have to do a short hike first. It's recommened to ascend via Rigidalstockface (Wall) and descend via the Rigidalstockgrat. Once on top the Rigidalstock you get a bit of a summit feeling which is quite nice.\
  Beware of the cable car schedule, if you miss the last one the hike down is a bit longer.
* [Hexensteig, Silenen](https://www.bergsteigen.com/touren/klettersteig/hexensteig-silenen/): This via ferrata is a bit special as it is enclosed in a gorge. One side of the gorge is open towards the valley. So occasionally you get really gorgeous views of the valley below and the surrounding mountains. In order to get to the via ferrata you can either take the cable car from the valley or hike up all the way. Even if you do take the cable car there is still a fair bit of hiking required to get to the entry point.
