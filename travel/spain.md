### Temple of Debod

The Temple of Debod is an ancient Egyptian temple that was dismantled and rebuilt in Madrid, Spain. Originally constructed in the 2nd century BC near Aswan in Egypt, the temple was gifted to Spain by the Egyptian government in 1968 as a sign of gratitude for helping save temples during the construction of the Great Dam of Aswan.

If you want to see the inside it's best to go early in the morning as the queue can get quite long, especially on weekends or during holidays. Only about 10 people can go inside at one time so it can take a bit of a wait until you get inside. The inside is definitly worth seeing as this is the only&#x20;

### Food

* **Gandario:** Tiny tapas bar. Had really good vegan sausage with fries and different sauces. But beware that it is tiny, if you come at a bad time you'll have to wait.
* **Vinitus Gran Via Madrid**: Highly rated tapas place with a nice selection. Indoor seating.
* **Tapa Tapa Montera**: Pretty good tapas with a nice area to sit outside in the street and enjoy a beer.
