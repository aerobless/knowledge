# Second Brain

> Building A Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we‚Äôve gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks. ([source](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/))

I use [[üíé Obsidian|Obsidian]] as my second brain. If you'd like to learn more about starting a second brain, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8) by Ali Abdaal is a good introduction into the topic.

# Digital Garden

A digital garden, similar to a real garden with [[üåµ Botany|plants]], is sort of public but also sort of private. From the street everyone can see into the garden, and some gardens can actually be visited by the public. The digital garden applies this concept to the second brain. It's still a collection of personal notes, but ones that can be public and where I believe that someone else might find them interesting or useful. This page is my digital garden. It is also written in [[üíé Obsidian|Obsidian]] and published with Obsidian Publish.

> A garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory ‚Äì posts are linked through contextual associations. ([source](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners))
