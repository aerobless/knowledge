Isotonic drinks are beverages formulated to replace fluids, electrolytes, and carbohydrates lost during intense physical activity. They hydrate faster than water because they contain a balance of electrolytes and carbohydrates that closely match the body's natural fluid composition. This similarity allows for quicker absorption in the intestines, effectively replenishing lost fluids and electrolytes more efficiently than plain water.

They are only needed for activities where you sweat a lot, e.g. during a hard [[üèãÔ∏è Gym|workout]], in very hot weather or when having diarrhoea.
