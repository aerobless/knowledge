description: Delicious pasta with truffle oil, optimised for meat alternatives
---
## 🥫 Ingredients

* 300g beyond meat or similar minced meat
* 1 can of Napoletana sauce (Barilla) or similar pelati / unseasoned tomato sauce
  * _in case of unseasoned tomato sauce, add salt and 1 onion_
* 1/8 tsp smoked paprica powder
* 1 tbsp vegetable broth (bouillon)
* 0.5 - 1 tsp of cayenne pepper
* dash of cinnamon
* pasta recommendation: AL BRONZATO (e.g. by rummo or garofalo)
  * _the sauce adheres better to the structure of bronze-pressed pasta and it will blend together nicer_

## 👨‍🍳 Instructions

### Sauce

1. Sear minced meat in oil. Chop up small. Beware that meat alternatives cook quickly.
2. As soon as meat browns up, add the whole jar of tomato sauce.
3. Fill the tomato sauce jar again half with water, add vegetable broth, shake it so the powder dissolves, add to pan.
4. Reduce heat to 60% and add other seasonings.
5. Let simmer for 40-60min, stir occasionally, if needed add more water to prevent sauce from becoming too thick.

### Pasta

1. Cook 1.5l water. A kettle can be used to speed up the process.
2. Put water in pot and add salt. Keep heating until water is boiling.
3. Add pasta & cook until **not** fully al dente
4. Drain pasta mostly, but keep about 1 cup of pasta water in the pot
   1. _the starchy pasta water will act as binder between pasta and sauce_
5. Add sauce to the pot and continue to cook.

## 🍽️ Serving

* Put hot pasta on plates and add truffle oil. The smell of the oil best unfolds while the pasta is still hot.
* Serve with Parmesan cheese. It's best when freshly grated and older then 36months.
