# Filling

- 4 beyond patties
- 1 bowl chopped spring onion
- 3-4 tablespoons soya sauce
- some water to thin
- 1 tbsp corn starch (optional)
- 1 tbsp vegetable broth 
- 2 tbsp olive oil

use chopsticks to stir filling
then put in fridge to rest while working on dough

# Dough

- 500g flour
- 3dl water
- 1 tsp salt

in a bowl, combine dry ingredients.
slowly and incrementally, add water while kneading until dough is combined. Kneading motion always from outside in with one hand.
Keep on combining the dough until it’s not sticky anymore and bowl looks somewhat clean.
To test if dough is ready, slap it or stick finger in: should be non-sticky, firm but still easily moldable
cover with damp towel, let rest for 30min

Roll out dough with a continuous supply of flour so it doesn’t stick until it is quite thin. Cut dough into lines and then cut triangles with one side being not really pointy. 

Put filling onto triangle and fold not pointy part upwards until it is a roll. Flatten the sides until tight. then fold the bottom together.
