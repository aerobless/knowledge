## Nutrition

* [Does Coffee make you happier: Yes, due to chemicals release, kickstarts production of neurotransmitters.](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/why-does-coffee-make-us-feel-so-happy-3/) Note: This only works in moderation, regular consumption causes a caffeine resistance that reduces its effects.

### High Protein Diet

* [How much protein is too much?](https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/when-it-comes-to-protein-how-much-is-too-much)
  * tldr; Typically it's recommended to consume 0.8g protein per kg of bodyweight. However a healthy person can probably consume up to 2g protein per kg without negative effects. So the range would be between **60g - 150g** of protein per day for a person weighing 75kg. What also matters is the kind of protein consumed. Healthier options are: low-fat dairy products (typical supplements), fish, nuts, beans and lean chicken. Red meat should be consumed in moderation.
