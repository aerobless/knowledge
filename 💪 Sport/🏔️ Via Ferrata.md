Via ferrata, from the italian "iron path", (german: Klettersteig) are protected climbing routes found in alpine locations. They allow access to difficult terrain and provide steel fixtures, cables and railings to arrest the effect of a fall. In order to climb a via ferrata it is necessary to wear a climbing harness with a via ferrata kit (shock absorbing lanyards) as well as a helmet. Gloves are useful too.

Climbing a via ferrata can be compared to climbing in a climbing park in terms of physical difficulty. The difference however is that in a via ferrata you often times climb over exposed terrain with real heights. So the mental strain may be bigger, especially if you have a healthy respect of heights. It is not recommended to climb an exposed via ferrata if you have strong fear of heights as it is often times not possible to exit the climb midway.
