## Cool Java Stuff

* [CodeScene](https://codescene.com/): Code Analysis / Code Health report, not free
* HTTPClient
* Structured Concurrency
* String Templates
* [Simple FileServer (JDK 20+)](https://download.java.net/java/early\_access/loom/docs/api/jdk.httpserver/com/sun/net/httpserver/SimpleFileServer.html)

### JPA & Hibernate

* [Digma](https://digma.ai/) shows suspected n+1 problems for code & DB performance issues
* DB Connection Pool sizing: keep pool small, 10 connections is enough
  * [Flexy Pool](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-flexypool-guide): helps to find the correct pool size
  * [Spring Boot Datasource Decorator](https://github.com/gavlyukovskiy/spring-boot-data-source-decorator): used to make using FlexyPool easier
* Disable: jpa.open-in-view
* Use TransactionTemplate instead of @Transactional&#x20;
  * can mark only part of a method to run in a transaction
* use getReferenceById instead of fetching data from DB
* n+1 problem: for every query we execute one more query to fetch data
  * solve with @Query to fetch additional fields or @EntityGraph&#x20;
* @DynamicUpdate. only updates changed fields -> but costs more memory/cpu
* Hibernate Hypersistence Optimizer runs as a test and shows you bad db configurations -> not free
  * alternative: quickperf, doesn't support newest spring boot yet but has workaround
    * can make test with @ExpectedSelect/Delete etc. to verify the number of db calls
* Fetch projections instead of entities for reading data. Only fetch entites when we want to modify them.

### Spring Boot

* Enable virtual threads: spring.threads.virutal.enabled = true (default false)
* Use TestContainers @Testcontainers annotation. Can connect to a docker container directly from the test.
* docker compose support in spring boot  -> spring-boot-docker-compose
* store the spring boot fat jar in an exploded fashion in a docker container is better for performance (both boot and resource access)
*

## Cool sites

* [https://inside.java/](https://inside.java/)
* [https://dev.java/](https://dev.java/)

## Cool IntelliJ Stuff

* Distraction free mode for focused work -> shortcut
* set custom project icon -> icon.png in idea folder
* Live template `cmd+j`
  * probably not really needed that much anymore due to AI
* **Debugging**
  * Expression Breakpoints in line for streams/lambdas
    * In Debugger: **Trace Current Stream Chain** -> visualises how the chain looks like
  * Interface Breakpoints
  * shift-click on variable, then side gutter -> have advanced tooling for breakpoint, can evaluate e.g. x = null everytime when the code runs by the breakpoint
  * Analyze dataflow: can see how many branches reach the same code
  * Have breakpoint only active if previous non suspending breakpoint was reached, can help to only get to specific state of method

## Cool AI Stuff

### ChatGPT

#### Priming tips

* Tell it: start every response with >, to produce markdown, then you see when it runs out of context
* Improve personal base prompt to reduce length a bit
* Base prompt
  * no ai disclosure
  * tell it how it should respond: asciidoc, prefered libraries etc.
* prime the context with small-talk

#### Solving problems

* When uploading documents, tell it to summarise before starting work
* Images in pdfs etc. are ignored, upload them separatly and ask it to understand
* **Tell it to ask questions about the task**
* Ask it to repeat the task you want to solve
* Rephrase the prompt instead of making a new prompt to keep the context shorter and to prevent poisoning the session with bad information.
* Let the system first describe with text the context and then ask it e.g. for a plant uml diagram
  * Ask the model to first explain how it would solve the problem

### Java ML

* Classical programming vs. machine learning
  * Classical programming -> we define the rules and the machine follows them to get an output
  * Machine learning -> we let the machine figure out the rules to automate the task
* Java Libs for ML
  * [DL4J](https://deeplearning4j.konduit.ai/), [DJL](https://djl.ai/), [Tribuo (Oracle)](https://tribuo.org/), JSR381 (Image Recognition Spec)
* recommendation: [DJL](https://djl.ai/), it's an interface to the real engines (pytorch etc.)
  * has pretrained model for tagging images, etc. z.B: resNet
  * easy to integrate
