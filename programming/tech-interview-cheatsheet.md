### Security & Encryption

* How are passwords typically stored for e.g. a basic webshop? Hashed
* Difference between Encryption & Hashing? Encryption is reversible, hashing is a one-way function. So hashed data cannot be translated back to its original state.
* What common types of encryption are there?
  * Symmetric Encryption: The same password is used to encrypt and decrypt the data
  * Asymmetric Encryption: A public key is used to encrypt the data and a private key is used to decrypt it. This allows e.g. lots of ppl to send encrypted mail to a single person that only that single person can decrypt using their private key.
