# EB

Elastic Beanstalk runs on EC2. It takes care of providing the right OS and platform. An application running on EB must use one of the supported platforms such as Node.js, Java, etc.

Versions of an application deployed on EB are stored in S3.

Inside an EB application are one or more environments (different configurations, e.g. for test, prod etc.).
