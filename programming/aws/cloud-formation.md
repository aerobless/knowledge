#### Cloud Formation Template

A cloud formation template is a JSON document describing the infrastructure that should be created automatically.

#### Cloud Formation Stack

A stack is a group of AWS resources created by a single Cloud Formation template. A template can create more than one stack but each stack needs to be named uniquely.

Cloud Formation can also update or delete a given stack.
