# S3

S3 stores objects in the region selected by the user.

An S3 object consists of file and metadata. The max file size of an S3 object is 5TB. The max upload file size is 5GB. To upload more you need to use the multipart upload tool.

#### Naming

A bucket name needs to be unique throughout all of S3. Objects are identified via their key (path + filename).

#### Access

By default only the creator can access an S3 bucket. This can be changed with [IAM](iam.md) policies.
