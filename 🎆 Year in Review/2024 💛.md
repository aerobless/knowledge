# Apps & services discovered

- [[📱 iOS#Useful apps |ElevenLabs Reader]]: AI reader app with multiple narrators. With this I can listen to the Wandering Inn as an audiobook.
- [[📱 iOS#Useful apps|Overland]]: iOS/Android app to track your location history and send the data to a server of your choice. I use it in conjunction with my own location history application called [[📍 Thereabout|Thereabout]].
- [[💎 Obsidian]]: I’ve combined my [[💡 Knowledge Management#Digital Garden|digital garden]] and [[💡 Knowledge Management#Second Brain|second brain]] in Obsidian. Previously I used [[☁️ Software as a Service#Note taking|GitBook & Notion]] for this but now I’ve combined everything into one big vault with a public and private part. This allows me to streamline my note-taking process and due to a fully file-based local copy I can also experiment with [[🤖 Tools|artificial intelligence]] tools that now also interact with the notes.

# Apps developed

# Workflows optimised

- Inbox Zero: To reduce time waste I’ve massively unsubscribed from advertisements and newsletters. I’ve also archived all existing E-Mails and I keep archiving anything that doesn’t need further interaction from me. This was inspired by H*.

# Goodbyes

- Gmail App: I’ve never been truly happy with Gmail since Google discontinued [Inbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbox_by_Gmail) in 2019. There’s nothing really wrong with the Gmail client, but it’s not especially innovative either. I’ve now fully switched to Outlook both on mobile and on desktop. The Outlook clients look and feel a bit more modern and having both work an private calendars integrated in one app is just more efficient.
