# Apps & services discovered

- [[📱 iOS#Useful apps |ElevenLabs Reader]]: AI reader app with multiple narrators. With this I can listen to the Wandering Inn as an audiobook.
- [[📱 iOS#Useful apps|Overland]]: iOS/Android app to track your location history and send the data to a server of your choice. I use it in conjunction with my own location history application called [[📍 Thereabout|Thereabout]].
- [[💎 Obsidian|Obsidian]]: I’ve combined my [[💡 Knowledge Management#Digital Garden|digital garden]] and [[💡 Knowledge Management#Second Brain|second brain]] in Obsidian. Previously I used [[☁️ Software as a Service#Note taking|GitBook & Notion]] for this but now I’ve combined everything into one big vault with a public and private part. This allows me to streamline my note-taking process and due to a fully file-based local copy I can also experiment with [[🤖 Tools|artificial intelligence]] tools that now also interact with the notes.
- [[🤖 Tools#Music Generation|Suno]]: AI music generation for various music genres, instruments & languages. Can be prompted with your own lyrics. I typically use [[🤖 Tools#Text Generation|ChatGPT]] to design the lyrics and then move to Suno to generate the actual song. I’ve already generated [several songs](https://suno.com/@eletiy) and I want to make more.
- [[🤖 Tools#Research|Google NotebookLM]]: A personal AI research assistant, optimised for working with documents, websites, videos etc. Can also be used to generate a podcast of the materials its fed with. This can be both be super interesting or hilarious depending on the source material used. Here’s example based on only the front page of my wiki.. 🤣 I find it quite funny. ![[SixtyMeters_low_2024.mp3]]
- [[2016 - 🏭 Factorio|Factorio Space Age]]: An extension to the base game that adds space platforms and 4 new planets to discover. It’s super fun and it adds a lot more content to an already awesome game.

# Apps developed

- [[📍 Thereabout]]: A self-hosted replacement for Google Maps Location History. 

# Boardgames discovered

- [Exploding kittens](https://www.explodingkittens.com/): My girlfriend Heidi surprised me with Exploding Kittens in an advent calendar this year, and it’s been a blast. It’s a fast-paced card game of feline chaos where players try to avoid drawing the exploding kitten card. Full of quirky illustrations and strategic moves, it’s quick to learn and always hilarious.

# Workflows optimized

- **Inbox Zero**: To reduce time waste I’ve massively unsubscribed from advertisements and newsletters. I’ve also archived all existing E-Mails and I keep archiving anything that doesn’t need further interaction from me. This was inspired by H*.
- **Unified Tasks:** Due to my move to [[💎 Obsidian|obsidian]] and also because I’ve taken over new responsibilities at work I’ve needed to come up with a better way of handling tasks. Having too many locations where tasks are stored makes it hard priorities properly and this leads to stress. So I keep all tasks in Obsidian, both personal and work related tasks. This is helped by two important plugins: [[💎 Obsidian#Useful plugins|QuickAdd]] to add a new task from anywhere with a quick shortcut and [[💎 Obsidian#Useful plugins|Tasks]] to add tasks management features to Obsidian. I keep tasks organized via hashtags (e.g. \#work, \#home, \#personName) and then group them using the features from the Tasks plugin.

# Goodbyes

- **Gmail App**: I’ve never been truly happy with Gmail since Google discontinued [Inbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbox_by_Gmail) in 2019. There’s nothing really wrong with the Gmail client, but it’s not especially innovative either. I’ve now fully switched to Outlook both on mobile and on desktop. The Outlook clients look and feel a bit more modern and having both work an private calendars integrated in one app is just more efficient.
- **Spotify**: Nothing *really* wrong with it. It’s just one less subscription. Because I already have YouTube Music (via family sharing) I’ve moved back to that. I’ve used [Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com/) to migrate my Spotify playlists, artist follows & likes over to YouTube Music. This worked quite well, but it does cost approximately 5$.
