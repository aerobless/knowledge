# ðŸš€ Space Sector

In my opinion it's a great time to invest into space companies, the field is still very young and there are few investable companies. Building rockets and space infrastructure is also a hard problem where it's easy to observe (from the outside) the success condition. Either you get into orbit or you don't.&#x20;

## Public space companies

* [**RocketLab**](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/)**, $RKLB**: has small re-usable orbital rocket (electron), large rocket in development, has successful launches, also builds satellites and other space infrastructure
* [**Redwire Space**](https://redwirespace.com/)**, $RDW**: US startup, builds space infrastructure, satellites etc. has many subsidiaries that focus on specific space infrastructure (e.g. 3D printing in space, thermal shielding technologies etc.)

## Private space companies

* [**Space X**](https://www.spacex.com/): leader in rocket launches, highly proven and re-usable, sadly not publicly traded, investments only possible with Alphabet and similar stakeholders
* [**Relativity Space**](https://www.relativityspace.com/): US startup that 3D prints re-usable rockets, no successful launches yet but seems very promising

## Notes

* [Private spaceflight companies & launch vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_private\_spaceflight\_companies)
