# ðŸ’° Finances & Insurance

## Pension

* [How many 3a accounts make are useful in Switzerland](https://finpension.ch/en/how-many-3a-accounts-make-any-sense-at-all/)
  * tldr; 6-10 accounts since they can be paid out from 5 years before pension age until 5 years after (provided you keep working), not all cantons handle tax progression the same way so it might not matter, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

## Insurance

### Personal Liability & Household insurance

* **Do you need additional glas breaking insurance as a renter in Switzerland?**\
  From what I can gather you don't. Glas breakage of all building glass (e.g. windows, ceramic stove etc.) is covered via personal liability insurance since you don't own the thing that breaks. (see [https://www.helvetia.com/ch/web/en/private-customers/guide/living/glass-breakage.html](https://www.helvetia.com/ch/web/en/private-customers/guide/living/glass-breakage.html)) If you want to cover additional stuff that you do own, e.g. aquarium, glass table etc. or you are the owner of the house then you may need additional glass breaking insurance.
* **Notice period for cancelling Personal Liability & Household insurance in CH:** 3 months
