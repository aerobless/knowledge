#### Communities

* [/r/Bogleheads](https://reddit.com/r/bogleheads): Reddit community about long-term, diversified, passive index investing
* [/r/ETFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/): Reddit community about exchange traded funds.
* [/r/Wallstreetbets:](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) Gambling addicts playing the stock market, generally a good place to see things that should be avoided. It's best to keep in mind that usually topics are overhyped and don't actually play out the way this community imagines.

## ETFs

* [$VOO](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo): S\&P 500, US only, TER 0.03%
  * historically S\&P 500 has done very well, this is no indication for the future. It is heavily focused in tech, which suits me well. [Reddit Bogleheads ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads)don't like this ETF as much, they would recommend more [$VT](https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/vt/vanguard-total-world-stock-etf) or [$VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti), [$VXUS](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus) combo to have more diversification.
  * There are other ETFs replication the S\&P 500 ($SPY etc.) what's the difference? tldr; there's very little difference in terms of performance, so it's worth it to take the cheapest ETF to reduce long term fees. E.g. $SPY has a TER of 0.09% so it's about 3x more expensive then $VOO
  * $VTI vs. $VOO: $VTI includes more stocks but has very similar profits to $VOO. In long-term investing it likely does not matter whether someone's investing in $VOO or $VTI
* [$VOOG](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voog): S\&P 500 growth focused, US only, TER 0.10%
  * heavier focus on growth companies in the S\&P 500, therefore higher possible return if this growth is realised. However the TER is worse than plain $VOO.
* [$VXUS](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus): tracks FTSE global all caps, only non-US (developed & emerging) TER 0.07%
  * [Basically a newer version](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/vxus-vs-veu/) (2011) of $VEU with more stocks. $VXUS and $VEU have pretty much the same curve, however $VXUS contains also small cap stocks. ($VXUS ca. 7000 vs $VEU 3000). This makes it more diversified for the same price.&#x20;
  * [$VEU](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/veu): FTSE, only non-US (developed & emerging), TER 0.07%
    * Good way to get exposure into non-us stocks.
* [$CHSPI](https://www.ishares.com/ch/individual/en/products/264107/ishares-spi-ch-fund): Tracks companies on the SIX Swiss Exchange, TER 0.10%
  * [the poor swiss](https://thepoorswiss.com/portfolio/) uses this for their swiss market exposure
  * It's a common tactic to have some exposure to your home stock market
* [$AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html): Small cap value, US only, TER 0.25%
  * good for tilting towards small cap value stocks in order to get an additional factor risk premium

## Special Corporate Situations

### Spinoffs

* Company A spins off a devision into a new company B
* Spin off companies can be profitable to invest in because of two reasons
  * For large institutional investors they're too small two invest in
  * For private investors they're two new and there's not enough analyst coverage. This makes private investors hesitate to buy the stock as well.
* This creates a window of opportunity where the stock of a newly spun off company is below its actual value.

### Mergers and acquisitions

* When company A buys company B they generally use cash + stocks to buy the other company. However sometimes company A will also use other security to pay for company B.
* When company A pays e.g. a part in bonds the investors receiving the payout will often just sell the bonds because they're not interested in holding those.
* This creates an opportunity to buy those other securities cheaper.
