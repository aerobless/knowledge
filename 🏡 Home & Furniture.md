# Bedroom

## Bed

* Mattress: 160x200cm, 18cm height (--)

## Pillows

* standard pillow size: 50x60cm
* when comparing IKEA pillows with synthetic (GRÃ–NAMARANT) and down/feather core (BERGVEN) the synthetic pillow loses it's plush shape more quickly. After about 6months the synthetic pillow is a lot flatter then the traditional one. -> tldr; down/feather pillow is better

## Bed linens

* Thread count matters, higher thread count feels softer/silkier and is more expensive
* standard double duvet size: 240x220cm
* fabric types
	* some fabrics require less maintenance, e.g. ironing.
	* jersey: t-shirt like, flexibel/stretchy, breathable and absorbent. Common for bedsheets, doesn't require ironing. Feels less luxurious then satin but may require less maintenance.
	* satin: light shine & crease resistant, non ironing, more expensive
		* lower quality satin can still wrinkle according to chatGPT, prefer buying high quality brands
	* ChatGPT also recommends: Micromodal or Tencel (Lyocell) materials due to moisture-wicking, and minimal wrinkling.
