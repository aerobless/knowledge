### [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)

Our World in Data is a web publication that presents empirical research and data on a wide range of global issues, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the world's major challenges. It often times shows that the world is in fact making a lot of progress and that things are not as bad as they seem.

#### Interesting metrics

* [Annual number of objects launched into space](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space)
  * The US is building significantly more space infrastructure than all other countries combined. This may be an indicator that the US still outperforms global peers in research and development of advanced technologies. And even more importantly the US was able to successfully transition from a mainly government sponsored space sector to a commercial one. This is one area where the US has a significant first movers advantage until some of its global peers are able to follow suit.

### [What are the safest and cleanest sources of energy](https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy)

Nuclear energy is both a safe and clean form of energy production. The fear of nuclear energy is  irrational and highly damaging to the fight against climate change. I strongly believe that we must build more nuclear power plants if we want to have any chance at stopping climate change. This of course should not stop us to also build more hyro, wind and solar at the same time. All clean energy sources must be harnessed so that we can keeping growing our economies and advance humanity.

### [Women Peace & Safety Index](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/)

Ranks countries by [inclusion, justice & security](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/index-dimensions/) of women. [Switzerland](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/country/switzerland/) currently ranks 2nd globally as of 2023. One metric where we can still do better is the "Women's Perception of Community Safety" index. It captures the percentage of women ages 15 years and older who report that they “feel safe walking alone at night in the city or area where you live.” Although it has improved from 79.7% -> 85% since 2017 I feel we should aspire to reach the level of Singapore (94%).
