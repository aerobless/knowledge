## Procrastination

* [Procrastination "cure":](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iow5V3Qlvwo) the premise of this video is that we know what we need to do to change things but simply don't want to do them due to too many other stimuli. To fix this we need to remove distractions. In the most absolute way -> do your task in an empty white room with no alternatives.
  * **What I find helpful:**
    * Set time limit on distracting apps, e.g. YT 1h per day
    * Remove triggers for useless/distracting activities, see [Habit Loop](habits.md#habit-loop)
