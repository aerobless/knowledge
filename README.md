# ðŸš€ Introduction

Heya! ðŸ‘‹  I'm Theo ðŸ˜„, a software engineer from the land of chocolate & cheese ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. I like to pursue creative endeavours such as developing my own VR game, building crazy automations for my home and various other stuff. Of course it's not all related to tech. I also enjoy travelling, photography, working out among other things.&#x20;

So why am I telling you this? Well you've landed on my "second brain", one of them anyway. If you're not familiar with the concept, it's basically this:

> Building A Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections weâ€™ve gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks. ([source](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/))

If you're not into the whole YouTube self improvement & self-organisation trend, it's simply a personal wiki that I use, so that I can find stuff again, that I've found before ðŸ˜….

In any case, this is my public second brain. I'm also using [Notion](saas/notion.md) as a private second brain and organisational tool. My Notion second brain is a lot more ephemeral. In it I keep stuff like todo lists, monthly and yearly goals, various recommendations for books, movies etc. So all information that's private or changing a lot I keep in there and everything else I keep on this page.

If you'd like to learn more about starting a second brain, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8) by Ali Abdaal is a good introduction into the topic.
