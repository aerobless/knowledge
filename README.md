# ðŸš€ Introduction

Heya! ðŸ‘‹  I'm Theo ðŸ˜„, a software engineer from the [land of chocolate & cheese](travel/switzerland/) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. I like to pursue creative endeavours such as developing my own [VR game](virtual-reality/vr-development/), building crazy [automations for my home](home-automation.md) and various other stuff. Of course it's not all related to tech. I also enjoy [travelling](travel/), photography, working out among other things.&#x20;

Welcome to my digital garden. ðŸª´ If you haven't heard of the concept before you can find a good primer [here](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). It's basically something in between a personal note collection ([second brain](knowledge-management.md#second-brain)), a wiki and a blog.
